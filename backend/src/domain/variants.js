/**
 * A **variant** is one box a product is sold in.
 *
 * Mangoes are not sold by the kilo off a scale. They leave in a six-kilo box or
 * an eleven-kilo box, and those are two different things with two different
 * prices, which is why they are two rows and not one product with a minimum and
 * a step. A customer orders two of the eleven and three of the six in the same
 * order, and that is three plus two boxes to pack, not thirty-four kilos to
 * weigh out. See docs/adr/0021.
 *
 * Every product is sold this way. There is no loose-quantity path: one way to
 * order, one shape of line, one thing for a report to add up.
 *
 * What a variant carries, and why:
 *
 * - `contentMilli` — how much is in the box, in the product's own unit. It is
 *   not for pricing, which is per box; it is what lets a pick list say "forty
 *   kilos from Chapai" rather than "seven boxes" when the boxes are different
 *   sizes. Two variants of one product may not hold the same amount: that is
 *   the same box named twice.
 * - `costPricePoisha` — what the owner charges the reseller for one box.
 * - `maxSellPricePoisha` — the ceiling, per box. Null means no ceiling.
 * - `stockQty` — whole boxes, and only meaningful while the product tracks
 *   stock. Boxes are counted, not weighed: running out of six-kilo boxes does
 *   not stop the eleven-kilo ones going out.
